# JoshuaCRivera.github.io - Jeapordy Question Search
-------------------
by Joshua Rivera

This was a project created for Capital One's Mindsumo challenge in Fall 2019. It is a web app that uses the JService API to retrieve Jeopardy question data and then presents it in a readible and user freindly format. Question searches can be refined according to catagory name, date it aired on the show and the point value/difficultly associated with it.

# How to use?
---------------
When the website first opens it will load the data which is usually relativly quick but does depend on the current internet connection.

Once it finishes loading (which is shown by a spinning loading icon), a random list of 100 results are presented to the user.

To make a search there are 3 inputs (Category name, date and point value/difficulty). 
1. To search a category start typing the name of the category until the desired result is seen in the drop down bar and click it.
    * This should be the last task as selecting a category automatically searches result. 
2. To refine search by date, either click on the day, month or year and then move it up or down with the arrows or click the drop arrow and search for the desired date.
3. To refine by point values/difficulty, select the drop down bar and select one of the options

* A category is required and must be last entered to make any search. Date and point values are both fully optional.

To make a new search, change any date or point value parameters needed, then erase the category search and start typing a new one and like before select it from the list.
